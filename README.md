# üö® Threat Intelligence Data Extractor üö®

Welcome to the **Threat Intelligence Data Extractor** project, developed by **Team Cyber Trace SSPU**! This Project was made as Solution for Problem Statement 1 in Hack IITK 2024 Hackathon Challenge round 1. 
This tool helps you extract and analyze critical threat intelligence data from PDF reports, including:

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**
- **Malware Details**
- **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**
- **Threat Actors**
- **Targeted Entities**

---

## ‚ú® Features ‚ú®

- **PDF Extraction**: Seamlessly extract both text and images from PDF reports.
- **Advanced Intelligence Extraction**: Identify and extract key IoCs, Malware details, TTPs, Threat Actors, and Targeted Entities.
- **Text Sanitization**: Safeguard your data by removing potentially harmful content.
- **JSON Output**: Export your results in a structured, downloadable JSON format.
